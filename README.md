# KrakenSnappy-Transition-Firmware

Welcome!

This is the Repository for the updated firmware on the Kraken. The goal is to update the firmware to be more user friendly and take advantage of micro ROS. We want the firmware to be largely transferable to the new Snappy sub system.

Workflow: <br />
  -When working on your code please branch from main and make changes to your branch. <br />
  -If merging your branch with main and you have made significant changes please have your pull request reviewed by other members.
